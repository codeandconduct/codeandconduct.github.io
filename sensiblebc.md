## Sensible BC

Sensible BC is a non-profit organization that is seeking to legalize
  marijuana in British Columbia.  They are a volunteer and donation based
  organization so coordinating people and disseminating information is crucial
  to their success.

Sensible BC elected to use [NationBuilder](http://nationbuilder.com){: target='_blank' }
  as their website platform.  NationBuilder is a platform specifically designed
  for political and non-profit organizations.  With modern tools, Sensible was
  ready to tackle it's agenda.

We were brought in to refresh the site's look and feel, and simplify their site
  structure.  The result is a site that looks fresh and appealing, and clearly
  communicates the organization's mission.
